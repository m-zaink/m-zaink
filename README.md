<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm an iOS Developer and a crypto-aficionado.

Following are some of the applications that I'm currently working on--
- [TwitterX - iOS Application written in Swift](https://github.com/m-zaink/TonyStark)
- TwitterX - iOS Application written in SwiftUI
- [TwitterX - Backend Application written in NodeJS](https://github.com/m-zaink/NickFury)

One specific repository I'm very enthusiastic about is [Web3](https://github.com/m-zaink/Web3).

If not engineering software prodcuts, I write blogs [@M Zain](https://medium.com/m-zain) and [@HashThree](https://medium.com/hashthree)
